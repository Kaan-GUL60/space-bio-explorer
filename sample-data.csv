"Spaceflight Affects Plant Growth and Photosynthesis","https://example.com/space-plants-1","This study found reduced photosynthesis under microgravity conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana plants showed significant changes in gene expression related to light harvesting and carbon fixation. The research provides insights into how plants adapt to space environments and informs future missions to grow food in space.","https://picsum.photos/seed/plant1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/plant2,https://example.com/plant3"
"Muscle Atrophy in Extended Space Missions","https://example.com/muscle-atrophy-1","Extended duration spaceflight leads to significant muscle loss in astronauts. This comprehensive study analyzed muscle biopsies from ISS crew members before and after 6-month missions. Results show up to 20% reduction in muscle mass, particularly in anti-gravity muscles. Exercise countermeasures show partial effectiveness.","https://picsum.photos/seed/muscle1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/muscle2,https://example.com/muscle3"
"Radiation Exposure Effects on Human Cells","https://example.com/radiation-cells-1","Cosmic radiation poses significant risks to human health during space exploration. This study examines DNA damage and repair mechanisms in human fibroblasts exposed to simulated space radiation. Findings reveal increased mutation rates and altered cell cycle progression, highlighting the need for improved radiation shielding.","https://picsum.photos/seed/radiation1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/radiation2,https://example.com/radiation3"
"Bone Density Loss in Microgravity Environment","https://example.com/bone-loss-1","Microgravity causes accelerated bone loss similar to osteoporosis. This longitudinal study tracked bone mineral density in astronauts over multiple ISS missions. Average monthly bone loss of 1-2% was observed, primarily in weight-bearing bones. Vitamin D supplementation and resistance training show protective effects.","https://picsum.photos/seed/bone1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/bone2,https://example.com/bone3"
"Plant Circadian Rhythms in Space","https://example.com/plant-circadian-1","How do plants maintain daily biological cycles without Earth's 24-hour cycle? This research examines circadian rhythm regulation in plants grown aboard the International Space Station. Results show that plants maintain robust circadian oscillations in space, though with altered period lengths and phase relationships.","https://picsum.photos/seed/circadian1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/circadian2,https://example.com/circadian3"
"Immune System Changes During Spaceflight","https://example.com/immune-space-1","Spaceflight induces significant alterations in immune function. This study analyzed blood samples from astronauts before, during, and after ISS missions. Results show decreased T-cell function, altered cytokine production, and reactivation of latent viruses. These findings have implications for crew health during long-duration missions.","https://picsum.photos/seed/immune1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/immune2,https://example.com/immune3"
"Microbiome Adaptation in Space","https://example.com/microbiome-space-1","The human gut microbiome undergoes significant changes during spaceflight. This research tracked microbiome composition in astronauts during 6-month ISS missions. Findings include reduced diversity and altered metabolic profiles. Probiotic supplementation shows promise in maintaining microbiome health.","https://picsum.photos/seed/microbiome1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/microbiome2,https://example.com/microbiome3"
"Protein Crystal Growth in Microgravity","https://example.com/protein-crystal-1","Microgravity provides unique conditions for protein crystal growth.

Results demonstrate the value of space-based research for pharmaceutical development.","https://picsum.photos/seed/protein1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/protein2,https://example.com/protein3"
"Cardiovascular Adaptation to Space","https://example.com/cardio-space-1","The cardiovascular system undergoes significant adaptation during spaceflight. This study used echocardiography and blood biomarkers to track changes in cardiac structure and function. Results show cardiac atrophy, altered blood flow patterns, and orthostatic intolerance upon return to Earth.","https://picsum.photos/seed/cardio1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/cardio2,https://example.com/cardio3"
"Neurovestibular Changes in Astronauts","https://example.com/neuro-space-1","Spaceflight affects the neurovestibular system responsible for balance and spatial orientation. This study used functional MRI and balance tests to assess changes in astronauts. Results show altered brain activity patterns and persistent balance deficits post-flight, with implications for mission safety.","https://picsum.photos/seed/neuro1/200/150.jpg","https://example.com/neuro2,https://example.com/neuro3"
